# shapeshifters-lab-landing

This is a concept mockup of the Shapeshifters Lab interactive landing page originally built for Wix, reimagined for GitHub hosting, demo, or static export.

## 🧠 Project Summary

The landing page is designed to:
- Introduce "Leo" and the Vault narrative
- Present 7 interactive tools ("Trials")
- Sell individual courses or full access
- Create FOMO through Easter eggs, hover effects, fake unlocks, and a glitchy UX

## 🔮 Technologies

- HTML/CSS (neon UI)
- JavaScript (interactivity)
- Optional: GSAP/Anime.js for glitch effects
- Hosted version originally built on Wix + Velo

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` – Base structure
- `style.css` – Glow styles, fonts, layout
- `script.js` – Hover logic, tooltip engine, fake unlock handler

## 💡 Future Additions

- Stripe integration (real payments)
- AI training dashboard (gated)
- Full character system (Leo reacts to progress)
